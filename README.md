## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting movie genres using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create models that can accurately classify movies into different genres based on their textual plot summaries. We explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve this classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains movie plot summaries along with their corresponding genres. The dataset is preprocessed to convert the text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the appropriate location.
2. Update the necessary paths and configurations in the code files.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Models

We explore different machine learning algorithms for movie genre classification, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines

Each algorithm is tuned and evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Results

Our models achieved the following accuracy scores on the test dataset:
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 58.05%
- Naive Bayes Accuracy: 23.92%
- Support Vector Machines Accuracy: X%

These accuracy scores suggest that while the Logistic Regression model performs better than random guessing, all models have limitations in accurately predicting movie genres based solely on plot summaries.
